# Gemini Development Guidelines for `rubi`

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the development process and guidelines for how Gemini will contribute to the `rubi` project.

## 2. Development Policy

- **Source of Truth:** All development will be based on the definitions and requirements outlined in `REQUIREMENTS.md`.
- **Go Version:** To ensure broad accessibility for many contributors, we will use **Go version 1.21**. This allows for a stable and widely adopted development environment.
- **Command Automation:** Basic and safe command-line operations (e.g., `go fmt`, `go test`, `git add`) will be executed automatically to streamline the development process.

## 3. Development Cycle

This project will follow a Pull Request-based workflow, iterating through the following cycle:

1.  **Pull Request by Gemini:** Gemini will implement a feature or fix, and then create a Pull Request for review.
2.  **Code Review by You:** You will review the submitted Pull Request, providing feedback or approval.
3.  **Merge:** Once approved, you will merge the Pull Request into the main branch.

This iterative process ensures quality and alignment with the project goals.
